This app basically serves as a way for families abroad to host other families when they are on holiday for a fee. Guest families can scout host family profiles, and through the app messaging feature, reach out and make arrangements with host families.

Host families can sign up and create profiles and include necessary details such as family size, images of their homes, family habits, and any other information that guests would need to know.

Another cool part of the project is that includes a simplistic payment route through the Paypal API, making it easy for guest families to pay host families for their stay.
